# CODEOWNERS file - defines who needs to review changes to specific files
#
# How it works:
# - When someone opens a PR touching these files, GitHub automatically requests reviews
# - If branch protection is enabled, the PR cannot merge without approval from code owners
# - Patterns use gitignore-style syntax

# Global rule: All changes need review from the main maintainer
# Replace "your-github-username" with your actual GitHub username
* @abhinav2196

# Critical application code - requires review from main maintainer
# This ensures core functionality changes are reviewed
/supraexporter/ @abhinav2196

# CI/CD and security-sensitive files - extra important
# These files control builds, deployments, and security settings
/.github/ @abhinav2196
/.github/workflows/ @abhinav2196
docker-compose.yml @abhinav2196
Dockerfile @abhinav2196

# Dependency files - important for security
# Changes to dependencies should be carefully reviewed
pyproject.toml @abhinav2196
poetry.lock @abhinav2196

# Documentation - ensure quality and accuracy
README.md @abhinav2196
SECURITY.md @abhinav2196
CONTRIBUTING.md @abhinav2196

# Note: You can add more reviewers later as your team grows
# Example: * @your-username @team-member-2 @security-expert
