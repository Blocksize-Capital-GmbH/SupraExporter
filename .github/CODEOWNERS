# CODEOWNERS file - defines who needs to review changes to specific files
#
# How it works:
# - When someone opens a PR touching these files, GitHub automatically requests reviews
# - If branch protection is enabled, the PR cannot merge without approval from code owners
# - Patterns use gitignore-style syntax

# Global rule: All changes need review from maintainers
* @abhinav2196 @BSC-aujl

# Critical application code - requires review from maintainers
# This ensures core functionality changes are reviewed
/supraexporter/ @abhinav2196 @BSC-aujl

# CI/CD and security-sensitive files - extra important
# These files control builds, deployments, and security settings
